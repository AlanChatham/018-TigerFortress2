018-TigerFortress2
==================

Team Fortress 2, if made in 1994 by Tiger Electronics

To run this, you'll need to download Processing (www.processing.org), 
then everything should run perfectly fine if you open up the 
"TigerFortress2/TigerFortress2.pde" file.

The "TigerFortress2Web" files (and the mess that is all the files
scattered around this directory) are for the Processing.js/HTML5
version that you can play at:

All the code is free to use however you'd like - drop me a line
if you make something cool with it!
